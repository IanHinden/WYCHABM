        /*The Shoat and the Boar

        In October, late October, He-Man, the master of the universe, spun and twirled and, in a formidable jump, heaved the might of all his weight onto a single unfortunate leaf. 
        At the resounding crunch, his eyes were winked with a jubilant grin, his snout crinkled and puffed with delight.The potency of a two - foot high cobbled frontage wall is 
        too much for a piglet to ignore, so, again, again, he clambered up.

        A breeze tousled his tuft of hair, jolting him to attention.The warm heat of his breath pushed against his cheeks behind his mask.In a quick panic, he peeked into his 
        pillow sack: yes, his treasure was all still there.All still there.Even in the late afternoon dusk through two oddly shaped cavities in molded plastic, he could verify.
        Relieved, he tightened the bag’s neck, and deftly swung it over his shoulder, feeling with his back the irregular lumps of future delights.Mighty pleased was the master 
        of the universe.

        Behind him, a stilted shadow marched along.A billow of smoke boiled out of the walking shadow.Cinnabar deepened and then ashed at the tip of a leathery - wrapped cigar, 
        tucked in between two faded and bristled dewclaws.

        The shadow grunted, and the piglet understood immediately: he was being too rowdy or rambunctious or felicitous.He began measuring his steps with precision now, 
        lest their journey end all too soon.

        Fear realized, the shadow, a large and lumbering Boar, stopped, a stony look in his permanently furrowed face.Another quick grunt, and he shifted his cigar from one side 
        of his mouth to the other.

        “Let’s take a look, then.”

        The master of the universe pursed his lips.He swayed his pillow sack from behind and presented it, two tiny hoofs holding it open for inspection.

        “Without that stupid thing,” the Boar waved at the piglet’s face.

        The piglet meekly pulled his mask up over his head, the taut string loosening and bristling the hairs on his neck.He avoided the look of the Boar and stared down at his candy.

        The Boar hardly moved. “Hrm, that’s enough, no?”

        Children have a luxury in that joy can never be measured in “enough”. 

        “Please, please just one more street, daddy! We didn’t go down that street, and I think the houses look the most fun.” The piglet pleaded up at his father.

        The Boar expelled an exasperated sigh. “Alright.We will go on until my cigar is done.Then we leave.”

        The piglet grinned, “Thank you, daddy, thank you!”

        The pair moved along down the new path where worries could be tucked away for a later time, one hoped.The piglet hastened his step, mentally tabulating his potential prizes.
        The emptiness of the street loomed overhead, an outdoor church where parishioners watched from tinted windows, whispering the prayer “Ooh, they’re coming”, offerings held
        tightly in preparation for the approach of little piglets.

        One hoped.

        Around a row of manicured and postured trees, the skewed house revealed itself.The slight ramp of the street gave the house the illusion of a forward lean, which, for a 
        tiny piglet, was easily magnified by the sugar rush of a few prematurely - eaten chocolates.

        The Boar stood back.

        With trepidation, the piglet approached the door.The skewed house had the uneasy air of a scolding teacher, the efflorescent bricks against thick, overpainted swirls of 
        stucco were stacked like arms crossed in a knitted vest, asking you, “well ? Well ?” But the piglet was determined.

        As the piglet climbed the steps, he was greeted with an unexpected tableau: atop a table sat an orange - colored bowl, adjacent to a small purple card.The card had a 
        simple note:

        “Please take 1 piece if you are scary. Take 2 pieces if you are very scary.”

        The master of the universe knew he was a force for good.But even good can be scary sometimes, he reasoned.

        He took two pieces of candy and merrily hopped down the steps, contented in his clever resolve.

        And the Boar, looking on, happened on his one singular pleasure in this world: disappointment.

        He spoke slowly and quietly. “What are you doing?”
        
        The piglet felt a chill tugging him off balance.He instinctively straightened up, not sure where to look.He took one hoof in the other, his mouth hung open.His father’s 
        stare held him in place.

        “I, uh, I,” He thought about the card.Did he make the wrong choice ? He could put a piece back.He would put both pieces back.He would put it all back if he could just go 
        home. 

        The Boar motioned around them, indicating the answer was in this very spot, surrounding them.The bewildered piglet felt his eyes reaching, failing to focus, too overwhelmed, 
        blurry, tears forcing themselves out. 

        The Boar grew angrier. “Are you really this stupid?”

        The piglet snuffled.His cheeks felt too hot.His head felt light and then suddenly as if the pressure would squeeze him down to the size of a pin, a nettlesome sweat began 
        to seep out of him. 

        “There’s no one around here! There’s a full bowl right there. Why are we wasting time like?”

        The piglet, ears swarming with the sound of his own heartbeat, put his arm over his chest. “I don’t know, I don’t know.”

        “Are you just going to be a loser for your whole life ? Or are you going to learn when to recognize an opportunity ? This is where the life I built is going ? To 
        a loser! To a loser ?”

        The Boar’s feral gaze reached towards the piglet, held back only by a cage of whetters and grinding tusks.He flicked his cigar to the floor.

        Crying quietly, the piglet turned around.He climbed the stairs of the skewed house.Not knowing where to put his hooves, he neatly folded the note and laid it face down.
        He held open his pillow sack, and grabbed the edge of the orange - colored bowl.*/
